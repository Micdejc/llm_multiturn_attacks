INFO ABOUT THIS SOURCE CODE

This source code provides functions to moderate conversation of the targeted LLM during the multi-turn attacks.
The main functions included are:

1. open_llm_moderation(): Moderate chat conversations with a opensource large language model (LLM) via the LM Studio server.
2. chatgpt_moderation(): Moderate chat conversations with ChatGPT of OpenAI via API.
3. rule_based_judgement(): Moderate chat conversations with rule-based judgement
4. process_moderation(): Moderate new chat conversation according to the selected LLM.
